## How to make a prediction

Steps to make a prediction in order to solve a problem:

- Collect data during a lapse of time
- Analyze data collected
- Apply any technique which may help make a serious prediction (for example: Statistics, AI, so on)
- Make data classification
- Assign probability scoring to every data kind
- Either suggest a solution for the prediction obtained or collect data from Internet about the solutions that may apply too

Problems that we could use to apply the steps to make a prediction:
- Car accident
- Health problem
- Making a decision about our children if they need to either move to another school or not
- Lack of money
- Job recommendation
- Hot weather or strong storming
- Common problems that people need to solve frequently
- Next elected president

**Nested predictions**

This new concept, nested prediction could be useful if we need to continue make new predictions after the first prediction approached failed. It means that if we did all the steps, mentioned at the top of this document, and eventually it failed, then we could use it as a trigger to fire new predictions, taking into account the data collected to make the first and original prediction.
