Microservice
===============

## Definition

It is a service which is available at any time that a consumer intend to connect onto it.
This service may provide confidential data, data, or may trigger other processes.

It is useful to use a microservice if you need to separate the back-end from front-end work.
and you need to make a quick task on the server side.

## Additional usage

A microservice generally provides a source of data. Anyway, you could use it for other purposes like:

- A middle layer which decides to call another specific microservice among other ones. This could be useful if you don't want to put all together into single one.

- Calling an application which was developed into a different technology such as C++, Ruby, Java, Go, so on. Then, this gets either the output or result from the application execution.

- Being used like a key to open or close a gate to another software program like:
  - software architecture
  - software system
  - security system
  - etc.
