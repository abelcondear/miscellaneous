## Typical questions about login intrusions

**How do you set the maximum number of login attempts?**

Instead of setting a maximum amount of attempts to hack the system login, I would try to attempt 10 times and I would see what happens then. Afterwards, I would try to attempt 50 times, then 100 times manually or automatically. I would make use of this type of strategy to set a maximum amount of attempts approximately.

**How long do you estimate the maximum number of login attempts? Could you set an interval time for either reviewing or estimating this number?**

Every 10 minutes I would register every login attempts during the current day. At the end of the day, I would perform statistics according to the different login attempts, using that data collected from that day. Then, I would study the statisticsâ€™ results to take an action to solve this inconvenience.

**What would it happen in case a user used several user accounts in order to penetrate into the system?**

I would try to review how many times a user tried to use false accounts to enter the login system
during the current day. Eventually, I would immediately stop the system login for a short period of time in order to prevent the automatic intrusion.
