## Database Checker


In case, you wish to build a Database Checker software, then It should be important that you have into account what issues are very common to find when we need to validate data consistence, data type, business rules, database tables relationship and so on.

Why it could be useful for the company, having a custom software as a Database Checker.

These ones, list below, could be the reasons. 

**Database Reflection**

You can use the internal functions from the motor of database in order to get all the necessary information about the server (where database resides) and database details (for example: database free availability, tables description, tables fields description, jobs currently running or active, etc.)
This information collected may be used to validate against the company, client and/or user expectations.

**Data Type Review**

You can validate data types corresponding to table fields and alert the user if any data type was wrongly set.

**Primary Key/Foreign Key Review**

You can check as Primary Keys as Foreign Keys whether it was properly created. Also, you may review if there is any PK or FK that is missing and needs to be created.

**Tables Relationship Review**

You can review if the database tables are related each other as it should be. In case, you may find any missing relation or additional relation which could be suppressed, then you should alert the user about it.

**Software Friendly Configuration**

You may have a json or python file where only the configuration may be there and every setting name could have a friendly name, also giving a friendly configuration structure so that it can be easy to read and modify by the user.

**Database Administrator Matter** 

DBA probably  may need to work with many databases during the same day or current week. So, this software could prevent some future possible crashes that databases may suffer meanwhile it is working and providing data to applications and/or services. Eventually, it could be highly important to use this software as an additional tool.

**Software Adaptable to any Relational Database System** 

This software may adapt to any RDBS like SQL Server, Oracle, Amazon Redshift, so on. It is a considerable advantage over other corporate software products.

**Object Database Execution Review (for example: Views, Stored Procedures, Functions)**

This software could run Stored Procedures, Views, or any other database object. Then, it may review if the execution succeed or failed. Alerting the user about it.
