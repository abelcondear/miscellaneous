Microservice 
===============

## Definition

It is a service which is available at any time that a consumer intends to connect onto it. This service may provide for example: 

- Confidential data 
- Data 
- Data structure or interface
- Object serialized
- Trigger other processes which run in a background over another CPU or new thread
- Etc.

It is useful to use a microservice if you need to separate the back-end from front-end work and you need to make a quick task on the server side.

## Additional usage 

A microservice generally provides a data source. Anyway, you could use it for other purposes like:

- A layer which decides to call another specific microservice among other ones. This could be useful if you don't want to put all together into a single microservice.

- Calling an application which was built up into a different technology such as C++, Ruby, Java, Go, so on. Then, your microservice gets either the output or result from the application execution.

- Being used like a key to open/close a gate to another program like:
      
  - software architecture
  - software system
  - security system
  - scheduled process
  - automatic process
  - etc.
