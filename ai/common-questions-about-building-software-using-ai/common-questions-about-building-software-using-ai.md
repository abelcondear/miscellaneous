## Common questions about building software using AI


**Describe a project where you applied AI technologies (e.g., LLMs, AI agents) to solve a real-world problem.**

- We can use AI technologies to understand data behavior and know what it is going to happen next.

- We can use AI technologies to find some pattern inside the data we are using and we could get from it, what we are specifically looking for.

**What was your role, what tools or frameworks did you use, and how did you ensure the solution delivered measurable value to the end user?**

We could ensure the solution delivered confirming the next assumptions:

- We reviewed the software development several times before it could be delivered.

- We made corrections on every code or software review.

- We created and shared documentation about the corrections we made before and communicated this in a technical and non-technical language.

- We made a presentation and show all the main features so that the end user know how to use them more properly.
